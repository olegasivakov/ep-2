# EP-2: ISO15022/20022 and MT format support

## About project

### Motivation

ISO 15022/20022, known as "universal financial industry message scheme", offers business modeles and data design rules related to financial market. Business modeles includes securities operations, payments, trade services, Forex, cards and related services. MT messages format ("SWIFT" messages) is a proprietary data format developed and used by SWIFT, the international provider of secure financial messaging service.

Blockchain now has many intersections with regulated financial institutions that use mentioned standards of data messaging. I believe that intersections will deeper and business possibilities will greater when regulated institutions and crypto enthusiasts start using common messaging standards. In particular, this means that the blockchain node should (_a_) read standartized messages from off-chain financial information systems, (_b_) respond to, and (_c_) send to off-chain standartized messages based on the results of transaction execution.

I started developing this project in order to provide blockchain businesses and software developers with the possibility of direct integration of on-chain and off-chain information systems.
